This is a Javascript application I use to mentor others about javascript.
It contains a simple basic application that covers sass compilation, classes and new methods,
and dom querying at a custom level.  There is no magic here except the use of ES6.

### Premis of application
Take this application and make a custom slideshow. the basics are ready to use.

### Get started
First thing first. Install all of the dependencies:
```
npm install
```

Once that is complete you are ready to go. open TWO seperate terminals.
In one terminal type:
```
npm start
```

In the second terminal window go to the `public/` directory and type:
```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 6969
```

You are ready to go.
